Day 4 Focus: Linux File System Navigation & Permissions

---

1. Learning Objectives

* Understand the "Linux directory structure".
* Learn "basic file & folder commands".
* Master "permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)" ‚Äî critical for system security.

---

2. Study Tasks

(a) File System Basics

* Important directories:

  * `/` (root), `/home`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/var`, `/tmp`, `/root`.
* Commands:

  ```bash
  pwd       # current directory
  ls -l     # list with details
  cd ..     # go up one level
  mkdir lab # make folder
  rmdir lab # remove empty folder
  ```

(b) File Operations

```bash
touch file.txt       # create empty file
cp file1 file2       # copy
mv file1 newfile     # move/rename
rm file.txt          # delete
cat file.txt         # read
less file.txt        # read (scroll)
```

(c) Permissions

* Format: `-rwxr-xr--` (owner | group | others).
* Change permission:

  ```bash
  chmod 755 script.sh
  chmod 600 secret.txt
  ```
* Change ownership:

  ```bash
  sudo chown user:group file.txt
  ```

 3. Hands-on Task

1. Create a folder `security_lab`.
2. Inside, create `notes.txt`.
3. Set permission so **only you can read/write**:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 notes.txt
   ```
4. Verify with:

   ```bash
   ls -l notes.txt
   ```

   Should look like:

   ```
   -rw------- 1 lithin lithin 0 Sep 26  notes.txt

4. Security Tip

üîê Incorrect permissions can leak sensitive files like '/etc/shadow'. Always use "principle of least privilege".
