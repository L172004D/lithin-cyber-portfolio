 🗓️ Day 06 – Linux Networking Fundamentals

Explored essential Linux networking commands such as `ping`, `traceroute`, `ifconfig`, and `netstat` to understand how systems communicate over networks. Practiced DNS lookups using `nslookup` and `dig`, analyzed routing tables, and configured system hostname and DNS settings. This day built a strong foundation for upcoming network monitoring and packet analysis tasks.


 🔹 Key Networking Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `ifconfig` / `ip a` | Displays all network interfaces and IP addresses | `ip a` |
| `ping` | Tests connectivity between systems | `ping google.com` |
| `traceroute` | Displays the route packets take to reach a host | `traceroute google.com` |
| `netstat` | Shows active network connections and listening ports | `netstat -tuln` |
| `ss` | Modern alternative to netstat, faster and more detailed | `ss -tuln` |
| `nslookup` | Queries DNS servers to obtain domain details | `nslookup google.com` |
| `dig` | Performs detailed DNS lookups | `dig google.com` |
| `ip route show` | Displays routing table and default gateway | `ip route show` |
| `hostnamectl` | Manages system hostname | `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname testmachine` |
| `cat /etc/resolv.conf` | Displays DNS server configuration | `cat /etc/resolv.conf` |

 ⚙️ Practice Tasks
1. Run each command in your Linux terminal and record the output.  
2. Observe how `ping` and `traceroute` work differently to test connectivity.  
3. Check your DNS resolution using `nslookup` and `dig`.  
4. Change your system hostname and verify using `hostnamectl`.
