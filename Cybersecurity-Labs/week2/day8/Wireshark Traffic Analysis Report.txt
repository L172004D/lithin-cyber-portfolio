🧾 Wireshark Traffic Analysis Report  
Day 8 – Cybersecurity Internship Fast-Track Plan

---

🎯 Objective
The objective of this lab was to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic using "Wireshark" to understand how data packets flow across a network and identify any suspicious or abnormal activity.

---

🧰 Tools Used
- Operating System: Kali Linux / Windows  
- Tool: Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)  
- File Format: `.pcapng`  
- Network Interface: Ethernet / Wi-Fi (as per active connection)

---

 ⚙️ Commands / Filters Applied
| Purpose | Filter / Command |
|----------|------------------|
| Capture HTTP traffic | `http` |
| Filter by source IP | `ip.src == <your_IP>` |
| Filter by destination IP | `ip.dst == <target_IP>` |
| Display TCP traffic only | `tcp` |
| Capture DNS queries | `dns` |
| Show HTTPS traffic | `tcp.port == 443` |
| Find packets with errors | `tcp.analysis.flags` |

---

 🔍 Key Observations
- Detected multiple "TCP and DNS packets" between local and remote hosts.  
- Observed "HTTP GET and POST requests", confirming web activity.  
- Identified "source and destination IPs", showing packet routing paths.  
- Found some "retransmissions" indicating minor network congestion.  
- No signs of malicious payloads or unusual port activity were detected in this session.

 🧩 Conclusion
Through this analysis, I gained hands-on experience with "packet capturing, protocol filtering, and traffic inspection" using Wireshark.  
This activity helped improve my understanding of "network communication patterns", "protocol structures", and "basic forensic analysis" in cybersecurity.
