 🌐 Day 07 – Network Fundamentals for Cybersecurity

 🎯 Objective
Today’s focus is to build a solid understanding of "computer networking", "including the "OSI and TCP/IP models", "common network protocols", and "port numbers" that form the backbone of communication across the internet.  
These concepts are essential for mastering cybersecurity tools like "Wireshark", "Nmap", and "Burp Suite".



 🧩 OSI vs TCP/IP Model – Comparison

| OSI Layer | Function | Example Protocols | Equivalent TCP/IP Layer |
|----------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| 7. Application | User interaction and network services | HTTP, FTP, DNS | Application |
| 6. Presentation | Data translation, encryption, compression | SSL, TLS, JPEG | Application |
| 5. Session | Connection management between applications | NetBIOS, PPTP | Application |
| 4. Transport | Reliable data transmission and flow control | TCP, UDP | Transport |
| 3. Network | Logical addressing and routing | IP, ICMP, ARP | Internet |
| 2. Data Link | Physical addressing (MAC) and framing | Ethernet, PPP | Network Access |
| 1. Physical | Hardware, signals, cables, and transmission media | NIC, Hubs, Wi-Fi | Network Access |

🧠 Insight:  
While the "OSI model" is theoretical, the "TCP/IP model" is practical and used in real-world networking. Understanding both helps map how data travels from one device to another securely.

 🌍 Top 10 Common Network Protocols

| Protocol | Full Form | Purpose / Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| "HTTP" | HyperText Transfer Protocol | Transfers web pages (unencrypted) |
| "HTTPS" | HTTP Secure | Encrypted web communication using SSL/TLS |
| "FTP" | File Transfer Protocol | Transfers files between systems |
| "SSH" | Secure Shell | Secure remote administration and access |
| "DNS" | Domain Name System | Resolves domain names to IP addresses |
| "DHCP" | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol | Automatically assigns IP addresses |
| "SMTP" | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Sends emails across networks |
| "POP3 / IMAP" | Post Office / Internet Message Access Protocol | Retrieves and manages emails |
| "SNMP" | Simple Network Management Protocol | Monitors and manages network devices |
| "ICMP" | Internet Control Message Protocol | Sends diagnostic and error messages (used by ping) |

💡 Tip: Understanding these protocols helps in packet analysis, intrusion detection, and network troubleshooting.

 🔢 Essential Port Numbers

| Port | Protocol / Service | Description |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 20, 21 | FTP | File Transfer Protocol (Data & Control) |
| 22 | SSH | Secure remote login |
| 23 | Telnet | Unsecured remote access |
| 25 | SMTP | Mail sending service |
| 53 | DNS | Domain name resolution |
| 67/68 | DHCP | Dynamic IP allocation |
| 80 | HTTP | Standard web traffic |
| 110 | POP3 | Email retrieval |
| 143 | IMAP | Email access |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure web traffic |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote Desktop Protocol |
| 8080 | Alternate HTTP | Used for proxies or local testing |

📘 Note:  
Cybersecurity professionals memorize these ports to recognize open or vulnerable services during "network scanning" and "penetration testing".

 📊 Network Data Flow (Packet Transmission)

mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User (Your PC)
    participant Router as Router / Gateway
    participant ISP as Internet Service Provider
    participant Server as Web Server (e.g., google.com)

    User->>Router: Sends HTTP/HTTPS request
    Router->>ISP: Forwards data packets
    ISP->>Server: Routes request over the internet
    Server-->>ISP: Sends response packets
    ISP-->>Router: Returns data to gateway
    Router-->>User: Displays webpage or content
