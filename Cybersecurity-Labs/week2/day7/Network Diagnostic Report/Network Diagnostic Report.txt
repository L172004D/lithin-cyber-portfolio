Explanation:
This displays network interface details such as IPv4 address, default gateway, and DNS server.
It helps identify your system’s internal network setup.


2.Connectivity Test

Command: "ping google.com"


Output:
Pinging gooogle.com [2404:6800:4007:83b::2004] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 2404:6800:4007:83b::2004: time=75ms
Reply from 2404:6800:4007:83b::2004: time=87ms
Reply from 2404:6800:4007:83b::2004: time=76ms
Reply from 2404:6800:4007:83b::2004: time=85ms

Ping statistics for 2404:6800:4007:83b::2004:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 75ms, Maximum = 87ms, Average = 80ms


Explanation:
ping checks reachability to Google’s server.
Low response time indicates a strong and stable internet connection

3.Route Tracing

Command: "tracert google.com"


Output:
Tracing route to google.com [2404:6800:4007:815::200e]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

Trace complete.


Explanation:
This reveals each network hop between your system and Google’s server, helping diagnose latency or routing issues.

4.DNS Resolution

Command:"nslookup google.com"


Output:
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  10.186.49.156

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    google.com
Addresses:  2404:6800:4007:815::200e
          142.250.77.110



Explanation:
This shows which DNS server resolves “google.com” and returns its corresponding IP address.

5. Data Flow Diagram:

sequenceDiagram
    participant PC as Your System
    participant Router as Local Router
    participant ISP as Internet Service Provider
    participant DNS as DNS Server
    participant Google as Google.com Server

    PC->>Router: Sends DNS Query (google.com)
    Router->>ISP: Forwards request
    ISP->>DNS: Requests IP for google.com
    DNS-->>ISP: Returns IP Address
    ISP-->>Router: Forwards IP info
    Router-->>PC: IP Address Received
    PC->>Google: Sends HTTP/HTTPS Request
    Google-->>PC: Returns Webpage Data

Step 6: "Push to GitHub"

Run these commands inside your project folder:
bash:
git add .
git commit -m "Added Day 7 Network Diagnostic Report"
git push origin main

Summary :

Through this report, we:

Identified network configuration details

Tested connectivity using ICMP (ping)

Traced data routes to external servers

Understood how DNS translates domain names into IP addresses

This mini project provides a practical foundation for network troubleshooting and packet analysis, essential skills in cybersecurity.
