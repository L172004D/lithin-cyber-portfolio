Room: What is Networking?  
Date completed: 2025-10-09  
Level: Easy / Free

## Executive summary
Short intro to core networking concepts (hosts, IP addressing, ports, protocols). Built familiarity with TCP/UDP basics necessary for recon and scanning.

## Tools / commands used
- N/A (conceptual room)  
- Notes taken: OSI vs TCP/IP, common ports (80,443,22,21), IP classes, subnet basics.

## Key takeaways
- Difference between TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless).  
- Ports identify services; enumeration targets those ports.  
- Basic subnetting idea (host vs network address).

## Next steps
- Do **Nmap room and **Network Fundamentals** practical labs to apply these concepts.
