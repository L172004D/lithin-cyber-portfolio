## Executive summary
Overview of pentest methodology and ethics: recon → enumeration → exploitation → post-exploit → reporting. Emphasis on safe/legal testing and documentation.

## Tools & concepts
- Reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation phases.  
- Importance of documentation, evidence collection, and remediation recommendations.

## Short checklist followed
1. Define scope & rules of engagement.  
2. Perform passive recon (OSINT).  
3. Active recon (Nmap).  
4. Attempt basic exploitation (in lab).  
5. Document findings + remediation.

## Evidence
- Add screenshots/notes to `THM-Labs/Pentesting-Fundamentals/proofs/`.

## Next steps
- Use this methodology for upcoming Nmap & Web PoC projects; create one pentest-style PDF report when complete.
