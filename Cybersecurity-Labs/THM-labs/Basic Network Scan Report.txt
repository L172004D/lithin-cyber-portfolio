 🛡 Nessus Essentials - Basic Network Scan Report
 🧠 Overview
This project documents a "vulnerability assessment" performed using "Nessus Essentials, a free vulnerability scanner developed by "Tenable".  
The goal of this scan was to identify and analyze potential security weaknesses in a "local network host" for cybersecurity learning and practice.

 🎯 Objectives
- Perform a "Basic Network Scan" using Nessus Essentials.  
- Identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a local host.  
- Understand the "severity levels" and "remediation methods".  
- Generate a "professional vulnerability report" for documentation.

🔍 Detailed Analysis

 🔴 High-Severity Vulnerabilities
1. Outdated Software or Service
   - Impact: The host runs an older version of a service that contains known security flaws.
   - Consequence: Attackers could exploit these to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
   - Remediation: Update the affected software/service to the latest secure version.

2. Insecure Communication Protocol
   - Impact: Unencrypted communication channels detected (HTTP instead of HTTPS).
   - Consequence: Data could be intercepted or modified in transit.
   - Remediation: Switch to secure protocols like HTTPS or SSH.

---

 🟡 Medium-Severity Vulnerabilities
1. Unnecessary Open Ports
   - Impact: Ports open to public access increase the attack surface.
   - Remediation: Close unused ports and limit access using firewalls.

2. Default Configuration Detected
   - Impact: Default credentials or configurations can be easily exploited.
   - Remediation: Change all default settings and passwords.

---

 🔵 Low-Severity & Informational Findings
- Missing or weak security headers.  
- Outdated operating system metadata.  
- Informational findings that can improve overall system hygiene.

These do not pose immediate threats but should be reviewed for best practices.
